Hi there, thanks for visiting my website! I am a third-year undergraduate at Xi'an Jiaotong University, majoring in computer science and technology. 

My research interest includes Graph Neural Networks, Socail Network Analysis, Knowledge Graph, Natural Language Processing and Graph Mining in general. I work on social network analysis and knowledge graph representation learning advised by [Prof. Minnan Luo](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/minnluo/home). I am also a member of [LUD](https://luoundergradxjtu.github.io/index.html) (Luo Lab Undergrad Division), the premiere undergraduate research group @ XJTU. More information about me could be found in my [CV](https://tamsiuhin.github.io/files/Zhaoxuan_Tan_CV.pdf).

Recently, I'm fortunate to start an internship at Tsinghua University, supervised by [Prof. Yuxiao Dong](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/yuxiao/).
